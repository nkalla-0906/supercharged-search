Using the Google Search python library

We had a list of colleges for which we wanted the eact links where one could find the college fees. IN this case, we realised that most of the time
the first link is usually the one we tend to go for, hence, I searched for a library that could help me scrape that information. 

This saved our teams hours of manual work.
